## Deploying ML Model using Flask
This is a simple project to elaborate how to deploy a Machine Learning model using Flask API

## Requirements
- Python 3.6
- Flask = 1.1.1
- numpy = 1.17.2
- pandas = 0.25.1
- scikit-learn = 0.21.3
- tensorflow = 1.14.0
- matplotlib = 3.1.1

Use Anaconda as a package manager to easily set up the environment before running the application.

## Setup

## Running the app

- Make sure you have setup the python environment with all the required modules and you have downloaded the dataset.
- Start the flask server with `$ python app.py` in the root folder of the project.
- Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to browse the app.
