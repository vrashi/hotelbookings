Drawing intelligent information out of a hotel bookings dataset

For this Project, I took a Hotel Booking dataset, cleaned it by handling missing values and managing the format of the data, performed EDA on it to understand it better and ran it through multiple models to draw intelligent information from it regarding the profits revenue, the possible bookings along with cancellations, and customer satisfaction of the hotel to ultimately 
predict the demand of the hotel and how can it be benefitted through data-driven analytics


There are reports in every phase of the project that describe the execution steps in further detail.
